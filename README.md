# VA_Composer

This repo contains an Automatic System for Stochastic Composition and Sound Design of Soundtracks based on Valence and Arousal parameters realized in Super Collider for a university project from the course of Computer Music.

The Automatic Composition Algorithm is based on a Stochastic Automata, which selects a different Musical Mode in relation to the Valence parameter specified by the user; the Sound Design Engine include both Valence and Arousal values to model the final timbre of the melody and the underlying harmony. 

In the repo you'll find: 
- VAc_main.scd -> Super Collider file containing the code; 
- VAc_relation.pdf -> report of the project (in Italian).
